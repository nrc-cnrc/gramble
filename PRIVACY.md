None of the applications in this repository perform any user tracking or analytics, collect personal information, record device information, use cookies, send any user data to third parties, or use any user information or data for the purposes of advertising.

If you use the Google Sheet Add-on, it will require read/write access to the current Sheet that you invoke it on.  It can read that sheet and perform limited modifications of it, but does not store or send any of the data to the authors, to the National Research Council of Canada, or to any third party.  It does not make use of any Google user account information such as your name, email address, devices, or recent logins, and will not access any other Sheets, any other Google documents, or any files in your Google Drive.  It only operates on the text of the Sheet and only for the purposes of generating results within that Sheet.

More broadly, you should be aware that if you use Google Sheets, Google itself will be storing your data, tracking user and device information, using cookies, and similar, as described in Google's [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and further explained [here](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10381817).
