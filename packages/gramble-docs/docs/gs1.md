Gramble is a programming language for *linguistic programming*: building tools that create or respond to human language words and sentences.  It's meant to be easier to read and write, so that people can make linguistic programs in their languages without necessarily having to have a degree in computer science.

Some of the tools you can easily make using Gramble include:

* Verb conjugators
* Writing system conversion tools (for example, turning "ᓄᓇᕗᑦ" into "nunavut", or the other way around)
* Pronunciation guides for computer systems that generate or respond to speech
* "Mad-lib"-style text generators ("I'm so proud of my ______ for ________!")

This tutorial will take you through a lot of the "background" ideas that you'll need to understand to make language technologies like these, and show you how to make them yourself. 

COMING SOON: If you're an experienced "linguist-programmer" (for example, if you already know a toolkit like XFST), we're writing a different version of this specifically for you, outlining the differences between languages like XFST and this language.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Gramble is by using our Google Sheets Add-on.  This will let you develop and test Gramble programs without having to download or install anything on your own computer/server.

The Add-on is not yet public, but it will be soon.  That kind of makes this tutorial impossible, huh?  Yeah, sorry.
