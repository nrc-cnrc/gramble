The easiest way to get started with Gramble is by using our Google Sheets Add-on.  This will let you develop and test Gramble programs without having to download or install anything on your own computer/server.

The Add-on is not yet public, but it will be soon.  That kind of makes this tutorial impossible, huh?  Yeah, sorry.
